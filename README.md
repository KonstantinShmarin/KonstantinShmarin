``` 
This repository is created exclusively for collecting code examples, for parsing code, parsing bad and good code examples. 
Here I also analyze test and training tasks. You definitely won't find the perfect code here =)

### Hi there 👋
#### My name is Konstantin.
<p align="justify">
The most difficult thing is to tell something objective about myself, but I will try.
My name is Konstantin. I grew up in st. Petersburg in Russia. I enjoy solving different tasks and play chess. I love early morning exercise and evening meditation.
And of course my family very important part of my life ❤️.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I think one of my greatest strengths is as a problem solver.
I have the ability to see a situation from different perspectives and I can get my work done even in the face of difficult obstacles.
I also feel that my communication skills are top notch.
I feel just as comfortable presenting to senior executives as I do mediating a conflict between junior team members.
I worked as a CEO in the past so I have that perspective of a manager and I think that they respect me for that.
I learned a great deal in that role that served me well over the next 7 years.

- 🔭 Now circle of my interest: 🤓 programming,🚀 new technologies, 🤩 English.
</p>
<p>
- I fond of WEB technologies 💪 and I study everything that is connected with it.
</p>
<p>
- 💼 There are languages that I interest for WEB:

#### 🚩My attitude to programming reflects the following principles:
<p align="justify">
<b>1.</b> The <b>KISS</b> principle:
The “Keep It Simple, Stupid” principle reminds us that all software or applications design and deployment should be done as simple as possible with least complexities and clear to understand development procedures.
This principle ensures that the source code is made easy to debug (whenever required) and future maintenance by any other operations and maintenance software engineer becomes easier.
Usually it is advised to keep only one method for one use case, in order to comply with the KISS principle.
</p>
<p align="justify">
<b>2.</b> The <b>DRY</b> principle:
The “Don’t Repeat Yourself” (or “Duplication Is Evil”) principle tells us that every software engineer should aim
to reduce repetition of information or methods within their work in order to avoid redundancy.
Therefore, it’s recommended to segregate the entire system of consideration into fragments.
Dividing the code into smaller segments can help manage the code and use a single segment at any point, by calling, whenever required.
</p>
<p align="justify">
<b>3.</b> The <b>SOLID</b> design principles:
The solid design principles are a set of combined principles that help to guide software engineers make software designs understandable, easier to manage or maintain, and convenient to extend or scale.
The <b>S.O.L.I.D.</b> design principles comprise of the following:
<p align="justify">

<b>S</b> — Single responsibility principle
Every module should be designed to carry out just its responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>O</b> — Open-closed principle
Any part of the software, should be available and easily extended for further features, but should not be modified.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>L</b> — Liskov substitution principle
Objects within a program can be replaced with instances of their sub-category types without changing the accuracy of that specific program.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>I</b> — Interface segregation principle
It’s best to avoid adding new functionalities or methods to an existing interface. Rather it’s recommended to incorporate a new interface and permit the classes to implement different interfaces based on the need.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>D</b> — Dependency inversion principle
We should always use a design pattern known as dependency inversion pattern, which is usually resolved by the use of dependency injection.
</p>

###### P.S. Well, nobody is perfect.🤔 I definitely get impatient with a task which I work so long time,  and occasionally I forget about principles.🤫OR If a new project excite me I will forgot about principle YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)😳.
